## <u>Markets Comparison</u>
* Here are some key factors to consider when investing in non-American stocks (in comparison with American stocks' performance).
	* __Size and liquidity__: The U.S. market is the largest by far, followed by Japan, the U.K. and Canada. This means the U.S. market has the highest trading volume and is generally more liquid.
	* __Sector composition__: The U.S. market is heavily weighted towards technology and healthcare, while the Japanese market is heavily focused on financials and industrials. The U.K. market is more balanced, while the Canadian market is heavily reliant on energy and materials. Location and geography played a big role in shaping the sector composition of the countries' stock market focus, although it's not the sole determining factor. Here's a breakdown of how different geographical aspects influence sector focus:
		1. <u>Natural Resources</u>:
			* Countries with abundant natural resources tend to have a larger share of energy, mining and materials companies in their stock markets. Examples include Canada( oil, minerals ), Australia (coal, iron ore) and Saudi Arabia (oil).
			* Countries with limited natural resources may focus on developing tech, manufacturing or service industries, leveraging their human capital on infrastructure. Examples include Japan (technology, electronics), Switzerland (pharma, finance) and Singapore (logistics, finance).
		2. <u>Climate and Topography</u>:
			* Favorable agricultural conditions can lead to a larger agriculture and food processing sector. Examples include Brazil (soybeans, coffee), Argentina (beef, wheat) and Thailand (rice, rubber).
			* Unique geographical features can affect tourism and related industries. Examples include Switzerland (tourism, hospitality), New Zealand (tourism, adventure sports) and Iceland (geothermal energy, tourism).
		3. <u>Trade and Logistics</u>:
			* Strategic location near major trade routes can attract shipping, logistics and transportation companies. Examples include Singapore (major port), Netherlands (Rotterdam port) and Panama (Panama Canal).
			* Landlocked countries may focus on developing manufacturing and service industries for domestic consumption or export. Examples include Austria (manufacturing, tourism). Czech Republic (machinery, automotive) and Hungary (automotive, pharma).
		4. <u>Other factors</u>:
			* Government policies can incentivize specific industries through subsidies, tax breaks or infrastructure development. This can influence the sector composition beyond just geographics factors.
			* Historical and cultural factors can play a role in shaping the economic landscape and favoring certain industries. For example, the U.K.'s financial sector has a long history and tradition.
		* It is important to note that these are just general trends and there are exceptions. The impact of geography varies depending on the specific country and its overall economic development.
	* __Regulation__: Each country has its own set of regulations governing its stock market. These regulations can impact factors such as listing requirements, investor protections and trading hours.
	* __Economic factors__: The economics conditions in each country ca have a significant impact on its stock market. For example, a strong U.S. economy tends to benefit the U.S. stock market, while a weak Japanese economy can hurt the Japanese stock market.

#Ethiopia
### <u>Introduction: An overview on Ethiopia's upcoming stock market framework</u>
* Ethiopia is on the cusp of launching its long-awaited stock market, expected in 2024-25. This comes after years of planning and development, driven by aspirations to attract foreign investment, boost economic growth and deepen financial inclusion. [The Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX)](https://www.esxethiopia.com/) will be a crucial piece of the puzzle, aiming to connect businesses seeking capital with investors looking for returns.
* __Framework and key players__:
	* The ESX will be established as a public-private partnership, with the government holding a maximum of 25% ownership. The Capital Markets Proclamation (No. 1248/2021) lays the legal foundation, while the [Ethiopian Capital Market Authority (ECMA)](https://ecma.gov.et/) will act as the regulatory body. Initial listings are expected from at least 50 companies, including banks, insurance firms and potentially state-owned enterprises undergoing privatization.
	* The ESX is scheduled to use a broker back-office system in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 12 months. This system will automate the core activities of brokerage service providers for trading on electronic platforms.
	* The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) and ECMA have also selected software to align with the CSD system for government securities, corporate debt securities, equities and funds.
	* furthermore, "a multi-asset market monitoring and surveillance system designed to facilitate the prevention and investigation of abusive, manipulative or illegal trading practices in the securities market. It will be deployed for ECMA, with an implementation timeline of 11 months in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."
* __Possibilities and potential__:
	* Mobilizing capital: The ESX can provide businesses with access to much-needed capital for expansion and development, fueling economics diversification and job creation.
	* Attracting investments: Ethiopia's large, growing population and strategic location make it an attractive investment destination. The ESX can offer foreign investors a transparent and regulated platform to participate in the country's growth story.
	* Financial inclusion: By providing retail investors with access to the sock market, the ESX can promote financial literacy and empower individuals to participate in wealth creation.
	* Economic growth: A thriving stock market can stimulate economic activity through increased investment, improved corporate governance and efficient resource allocation.
* __Factor that may affect the performance of the stock market__:
	* Number of listed companies: Tracking the initial number of listings and subsequent growth in the market capitalization will reflect the level of participation and investor confidence.
	* Trading volume and liquidity: High trading volumes and efficient price discovery will indicate a healthy and active market.
	* Investor participation: Measuring the participation of both domestic and foreign investors is crucial for gauging the market's reach and inclusivity.
	* Economic impact: Studying ESX's impact on GDP growth, job creation and foreign direct investment will provide insights into its overall contribution to the economy.
	* Governance and transparency: Strong governance and adherence to international standards will be essential for building trust and attracting long-term investors.
* __Challenges and considerations__:
	* Despite the potential, challenges remain:
		1. <u>Regulatory framework</u>: Ensuring a robust and efficient regulatory framework will be critical to protect investors and maintain market integrity.
		2. <u>Investor awareness</u>: Building awareness and financial literacy among the population will be key to increasing retail investor participation.
		3. <u>Infrastructure development</u>: Strengthening the supporting infrastructure, including brokerage firms and technology, is necessary for a smooth functioning market.
		4. <u>Macroeconomic stability</u>: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and addressing inflationary pressures will be crucial for investor confidence.
* __Opportunities__:
	* Potential for capital appreciation: Over the long term, stocks have historically provided the potential for significant capital appreciation. This means your initial investment can grow in value, potentially outpacing inflation.
	* Dividend income: Many listed companies pay dividend to their shareholders. These dividends can provide a steady stream of income, making stocks attractive to income-seeking investors.
	* Portfolio diversification: Investing in a variety of stocks allows you to diversify your portfolio. Diversification can help spread risks, as different stocks may react differently to economic and market conditions.
	* Liquidity: Listed shares are generally highly liquid, meaning you can easily buy and sell them on ESX compared to other private companies. This liquidity allows you to convert your investments into cash relatively quickly.
	* Investment choice: The ESX offers a wide range of investment choices. You can invest in individual stocks, exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds, each with its own risk-return profile (added benefit to risk profiles since invested using the local currency).
### <u>Debut: Exchange planning mid-2024 debut with initial listings of 15 firms</u>
* Officials plan a modest start for the ESX, set to launch mid-2024, aiming to initially list just 15 firms with the hopes of expanding to 50 listed companies within a decade.
* ESX coordinators at the Project Office, formed to facilitate the launch process, plan to finalize registration and acquire business licenses by September 2023. They also aim to apply for an operating license from ECMA by December 2023.
* At least five state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will debut in the first year, with most of the initial listings from private firms. Currently, only Ethio Telecom has confirmed to list on the fledgling exchange, indicating the long road ahead to meet lofty ambitions.
* The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) is also among the SEOs planned for listing. But CBE President, Abe Sano, said new policies must first be introduced to allow the state bank to float shares. "CBE listing is inevitable", Abe said, "But that doesn't necessarily mean we'll immediately sell shares".

### <u>Stocks to invest in</u>
1. <u>Investing in Ethio Telecom (Long-term Investment Plan)</u>
	#EthioTelecom 
	* [Ethio Telecom](https://www.ethiotelecom.et/) is a state-owned telecom provider that first introduced telephone services in the 1900s and was a monopoly provider until 2020. It is the 2nd largest in subscriber base in Africa and 21st in the world.

	* Potential advantages of investing in Ethio Telecom:
		i. <u>Market growth potential</u>
		* __Large, untapped market__: Ethiopia has a young and growing population with a low teledensity, meaning there's a significant potential customer base for telecom services. This suggests room for future growth in the market.
		* __Economic potential__: Ethiopia's economy is experiencing strong growth and increased private sector involvement in the telecom sector could further boost this trend.
		ii. <u>Company strengths</u>
		* __Robust infrastructure__: Ethio Telecom has a well-established infrastructure network, which could be a valuable asset for any investor.
		* __Strong financial performance__: The company has a history of strong financial performance, which could indicate its potential for future profitability.
		* __Competitive advantage__: Being the incumbent operator with existing infrastructure and customer base could give Ethio Telecom an edge over new entrants in the market.
		iii. <u>Additional factors</u>
		* __Government support__: The Ethiopian government is actively supporting the privatization process and the development of the telecom sector, which could create a favorable environment for investors.
		* __Potential for dividends__: As a publicly traded company, Ethio Telecom could offer investors the potential for dividend payments.
	* Potential risks (minor):
		* __Market competition__: The entry of a new operator, Safaricom, will introduce competition to the market, which could impact Ethio Telecom's market share and profitability.
		* __Regulatory uncertainty__: The regulatory environment for the telecom sector in Ethiopia is still evolving, which could introduce unforeseen challenges for investors.
		* __Overall market conditions__: Broader economic and political factors in Ethiopia and the region could also impact the performance of Ethio Telecom and the potential return on investment.
	* Crunching the numbers:
		* A valuation a year ago suggested that Ethio Telecom was worth 80 Billion Birr (about $1.5 Billion).
		* With a valuation of over 80 Billion Birr, and a share of 10% being sold:
