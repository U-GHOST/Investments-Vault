## <u>Introduction: The Business of Funding Wars and Private Security</u>
* Defense Contractors are business organizations or individuals that provide products or services to military or intelligence departments of governments. These contractors play a crucial role in supporting military operations by supplying items like aircraft, ships, vehicles, weaponry and electronic systems, as well as offering services such as logistics, technical support, training and engineering support in collaboration with the government.
* PMCs, or Private Military Companies, on the other hand refer to a commercial organization where employees are paid to carry out military or security duties in cooperation with or in place of regular military formations. PMCs are separate from official military forces and operate for profit rather than national defense purposes.
	* These companies also offer a range of services such as security, training, logistics and sometimes combat operations.
	* The activities of PMCs can raise ethical and legal concerns due to their involvement in conflict zones and potential lack of oversight.
